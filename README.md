# Day-Scheduler

## Description

I was motivated to complete this project to gain a larger understanding on how to make a day planner work and create a time element on a webpage. I completed this to showcase my skills to whoever may be looking for a personal day scheduler.
I built this project to deliver the client a calender they can edit and add events into.
Created a Scheduler to deliver to the client so they manage their time.
I learned better HTML coding and practiced going through the motions of JavaScript.
